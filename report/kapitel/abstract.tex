Even if the development of the benefits management (BM) approach, which can be used to gain long-term benefits out of investments in information systems and information technology (IS/IT), was developed in 1996 the today's adoption rate in practice is low. By using components of a business intelligence (BI) platform as artefacts of a benefit management process the acceptance for the use of benefit management can be increased. To do so, it is important to follow specific design guidelines for a BI platform which are at least correlated with design principles and acceptance variables of benefits management itself.
